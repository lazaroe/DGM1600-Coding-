He lived in a hole in the ground.
He was surrounded by other Hobbits.
He lived in the shire.
His name was yolo swagens
Gandawg visited him.
they decided to go to the pimpty mountain.

they met a giant dude
They took him down
they met some new friends.
They rode horses
They met a nasty dog
They kicked him
They got to a forrest of nasty peeps and met niggolas
got past safely
got to the mountain
met a nasty giant racoon
racoon got mad
